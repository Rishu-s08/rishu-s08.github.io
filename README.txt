Rishi Sharma — One-page Portfolio
=================================

What's included
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- This ZIP is a ready-to-deploy static site.

How to use
1. Extract the folder and open `index.html` locally to preview.
2. Replace text, project placeholders, and social links in `index.html`.
3. Contact form: the form currently has a placeholder Formspree action:
   https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id
   - Sign up at https://formspree.io/ (or Getform/Formcarry) and copy your form endpoint.
   - Replace the `action` attribute in the `<form>` with your endpoint to enable email delivery.
   - Or keep the mailto link as fallback.

Hosting (free)
- GitHub Pages:
  1. Create a new public repo.
  2. Upload the files.
  3. In repo Settings → Pages, set branch to `main` (or gh-pages) and folder to `/root`.
  4. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

- Netlify:
  - Drag & drop the folder in Netlify's Sites dashboard or connect your GitHub repo.

Customization tips
- Change accent colors in `:root` of `styles.css`.
- Replace the SVG blob with a personal avatar or illustration.
- Update project cards with real repo links.

Enjoy! — If you want I can also:
- Hook up a working Formspree endpoint for you (you'll need to create a free Formspree form and paste the endpoint here).
- Convert this to a GitHub Pages workflow with a README that explains commit steps.
